Introduction:

This program helps you do calculations for various calculations that are done on a daily basis. Whether you are a high school student, an adult or a future traveller, the functions present within the calculator help you out. 
By combining Python code and HTML, we made an interactive website that provides various calculations like profit and tax. The HTML side was for the website itself but the calculations and the results are provided thanks to Python.

Instructions:

Carefully read the instructions present on the website for the function you want to look at. Type in the code required for the function in the interactive box found after clicking the link on the new website and then input numbers as directed.
You get your results once you are done putting in numbers and if you want use another calculator, go back until you get back to the home screen. 

What was done in class?

Each day we devlopped different ideas for our project and we consistently collaborated on our code. We both collaborated on the HTML and Python sides of things and our vision for the website. We completed the google form, the mock up, and the flowchart. 
We finished the code and our website worked.

Problems/Modifications:

At first, our picture wasn't showing up so we had to go on W3schools to see what the problem was. Additionally, our code wasn't running if we didn't input things properly. Therefore, we made it so you don't get a syntax error.
